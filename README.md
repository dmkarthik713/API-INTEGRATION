##
As part of my first internship, I undertook a hands-on full stack development task focused on real-time API integration. The objective was to build a functional and responsive weather forecast application that retrieves live weather data from an external API and displays it dynamically in the browser using core web technologies. This project provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of client-side logic, data handling, and API-driven applications.
To streamline development and manage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript cleanly, I used CodePen, a powerful online IDE that allows independent scripting of each component. Its intuitive interface made it easier to debug and test features in real-time, and the separation of code blocks reduced confusion, especially when working with asynchronous calls in JavaScrip
In my first hands-on project, I built a responsive weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on JSFiddle, integrating the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on user input. I structured the interface with HTML, styled it for responsiveness with CSS, and used JavaScript to handle user interactions, API requests, and dynamic DOM updates. Through this experience, I gained practical knowledge in asynchronous programming, error handling, and presenting API responses in a user-friendly format. I enhanced my learning through platforms like MDN, W3Schools, and Stack Overflow, which helped me troubleshoot and follow best practices. This project boosted my confidence and deepened my interest in full stack development and real-time webÂ applications.
